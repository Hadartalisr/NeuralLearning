function [predicted_labels, last_layer_activation] = predict(weights, X)
% 'predict' takes as input a cell array of the weights and a matrix (X) 
% whose columns are images [784 X num_samples]. The outputs should be a
% vector of the predicted labels for each image, and a matrix whose columns
% are the activation of the last layer for each image.
% last_layer_activation should be of size [10 X num_samples]
% predicted_labels should be of size [1 X num_samples]
% The predicted label should correspond to the index with maximal
% activation in the last layer (don't forget to adjust the index to account
% for label 0)
