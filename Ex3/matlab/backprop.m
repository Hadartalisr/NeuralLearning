function [grads, mean_loss] = backprop(weights,X,y)
% This function receives a set of weights, a matrix with images as columns
% and a vector of corresponding labels. The output should be a cell array
% with the gradients of the loss with respect to the weights, averaged over
% the samples. It should also output the average loss of the samples.
% 'weights' is a cell array of length L where the n-th cell contains the
% connectivity matrix between layer n-1 and layer n.
